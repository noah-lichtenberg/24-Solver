# 24-Solver
Brute force method of solving 24 games. Prints one solution to making 24 using 4 numbers and 3 elementary operations (+ - * /) in any order. Prints "No Solution" if no solution is found. 

While it is already possible to print all solutions using the existing code, next steps would be to print all possible solutions without repeats, and possibly incerasing efficiency. 

All code except for the functions evaluating prefix expressions and converting prefix expressions to infix form are written by myself.
